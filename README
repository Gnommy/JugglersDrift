    And for as much as I profess rather to discover than teach
    these mysteries, it shall suffice to signify unto you that
    the endeavour and drift of jugglers is only to abuse men's
    eyes and judgements.
                          --Reginald Scot
                          "The Discoverie of Witchcraft", 1584
