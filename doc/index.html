<h1>Jugglers' Drift Specification</h1>

<h2>Footwork</h2>

<h3>Establishing initial positions; Cartesian coordinates</h3>

<blockquote><pre>
#jugglers Alice Bob Carol
#r P1 (10,0)
#r P2 (0,-5)
#r P3 (0,5)
t=1: Alice.pos = P1; Alice.face = (0,0)
t=1: Bob.pos = P2; Bob.face = Alice.pos
t=1: Carol.pos = P3; Carol.face = Alice.pos
</pre></blockquote>

<p> The <tt>#jugglers</tt> directive tells the names of the jugglers, and at the same
time indicates how many jugglers there are in the pattern. Internally, the jugglers
are numbered starting at 1; <tt>Juggler[1]</tt> is a synonym for <tt>Alice</tt> in
this example.

<p> Timesteps are also numbered starting at 1.

<h3>Polar coordinates</h3>

<blockquote><pre>
#jugglers Alice Bob Carol
#r C (0,0)
t=1: Alice.pos = 5*(0 deg); Alice.face = (0,0)
t=1: Bob.pos = 5*(120 deg); Bob.face = (0,0)
t=1: Carol.pos = 5*(240 deg); Carol.face = (0,0)
</pre></blockquote>

<p> The syntax <tt>(<i>expr</i> deg)</tt> means "the Cartesian vector obtained by
going out 1 unit along the ray at <tt><i>expr</i></tt> degrees from (0,0)".
The angle is measured from standard position, i.e., <tt>(0 deg)</tt> is equivalent
to <tt>(1,0)</tt> and <tt>(90 deg)</tt> is equivalent to <tt>(0,1)</tt>.

<h3>Defining movement</h3>

<blockquote><pre>
t=3: Bob.pos = (-3,0); Carol.pos = (0,0)
t=5: Bob.pos = P3; Carol.pos = P2
</pre></blockquote>

<p> Movement is interpolated between the specified positions and times (basically in
a straight line for now, but in v2 it should follow a nice spline curve).

<p> If <tt>Juggler[i].face</tt> is defined, then the juggler will turn to face that
absolute position. Facing is also smoothly interpolated between the specified facings
and times.

<h2>Passing</h2>

<p> Passing uses standard multihand notation.  The suffix <tt>x</tt> on a throw means
that it's a jim (thrown to the opposite hand from what you'd expect).

<blockquote><pre>
t=1: Alice (-,3:Bob)
t=1: Bob (-,3:Alice)
t=3: Alice (-,3:Carol)
t=3: Carol (-,3:Alice)
</pre></blockquote>

<h2>Looping the pattern</h2>

<p> To loop a pattern repeatedly, use the <tt>#splice</tt> directive:

<blockquote><pre>
t=1: Alice (-,3:Bob)
t=1: Bob (-,3:Alice)
t=3: Alice (-,3:Carol)
t=3: Carol (-,3:Alice)
t=5: #splice t=1
</pre></blockquote>

This causes everybody to repeat their pattern starting from the given timestep.

<h2>Extensible patterns</h2>

<p> Certain patterns (e.g. line feed, Feast, Jim's Feast, Seattle Shuffle)
take an arbitrary number of jugglers. Those patterns can be represented by
"extensible" pattern files where the number of jugglers is not fixed.

<p> Run one of these files using a command line like
<tt>./jdrift -n 5 feed.pass</tt>. The number after the <tt>-n</tt> indicates
the total number of jugglers. If <tt>-n</tt> is not given, then the file
itself may provide a default using the syntax <tt>(default 5)</tt>.

<p> Within the file, the current number of jugglers can always be obtained
using the meta-variable <tt>#Jugglers</tt>.

<blockquote><pre>
#jugglers Alice Bob ... (default 5)
#r P1 (10,0)
#r P2 (0,-5)
#r P3 (0,5)
t=1: Alice.pos = (0,0); Alice.face = Alice.pos+(1,0)  ! juggler 1
t=1: Bob.pos = (3,5); Bob.face = Bob.pos-(1,0)        ! juggler 2
t=1: Juggler[2*i+1].pos = (6*i,0)                     ! juggler 3,5,etc.
t=1: Juggler[2*i].pos = (6*i-3,5)                     ! juggler 4,6,etc.
</pre></blockquote>

The syntax <tt>Juggler[<i>arith-expr</i>]</tt> implicitly refers to <i>all</i> unnamed
jugglers with an index that matches <tt><i>arith-expr</i></tt>. This is determined
internally by the following algorithm:
<ol>
 <li>Identify all unbound identifiers within <tt><i>arith-expr</i></tt>s in the current
     statement. If there are no unbound identifiers (e.g., <tt>Juggler[3+7]</tt>), then
     give an error. If there are more than one, then give a different error. Otherwise,
     there is exactly one unbound identifier in there (e.g., <tt>Juggler[2*i]</tt>).
     Let's call it <i>i</i>.</li>
 <li>Evaluate <tt><i>arith-expr</i></tt> for <i>i</i> in [0,#JugglerCount].</li>
 <li>Evaluating <tt><i>arith-expr</i></tt> may result in an index which is out of
     bounds (remember, the only valid indices are those less than <tt>#JugglerCount</tt>
     and greater than the number of named jugglers in the pattern). If an index is
     out of bounds, then just ignore it; don't evaluate the statement's side-effects
     for that index.</tt>
 <li>But if <tt><i>arith-expr</i></tt> is in-bounds, then go on to evaluate the whole
     statement. Notice that the unbound variable is allowed to appear anywhere in the
     statement.
</ol>
